				The first appearance of a GT3-Ferrari at the 42nd 24hours of the Nürburgring did not end in a successful way for Pierre Ehret, and his teammates Alexander Mattschull, Andrea Barlesi and Mike Jäger. An off-course excursion after a tire damage at the “Flugplatz”-section on the Nürburgring Nordschleife on sunday morning 6 O´Clock, ended a nealy faultless race at halfway distance for the Ferrari-squad and its green machine. Pierre Ehret was at the wheel and was cruising on a solid 19th overall when the deciding incident happened in his 86th lap.

			In the qualifying the GT-Corse by Rinaldi Racing crew claimed a first success. A fastest lap of 8:33,491 guaranteed the team one of 11 free slots for the Top-30 qualifying and  – more important – the installation of a blue-flashlight that indicates the approaching of a fast car for slower opponents during the race. In the Top-30 qualifying pilot Alexander Mattschull confirmed the teams performance with another 8:33,521 lap and the 29th spot on the 167 car big grid.
			</br>
			Also teammanager Danny Pfeil (GT-Corse by Rinaldi Racing) made positive conclusions after the race: “It was a great battle and it was exciting for all the 24 hours. Unfortunately we missed our goal  to archieve a Top-10 spot,  but we are satisfied with our performance. We would have loved to archieve a finish. But the reliability and the regular lap-times were very impressive. I guarantee that we will be back with our Ferrari in 2015!”
